# etch-a-sketch

In this small project, the main goal is to test the skills that I got over the few weeks about JavaScript, mainly DOM.
To test it, I have to create a webpage similar to the game etch-a-sketch, using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
Once it's done, the live preview will be down this description.
